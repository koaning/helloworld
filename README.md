This is a helloworld package in R that should just work. It doens't do anything complicated
and it serves as a starting point for people who want to make a start at having their own 
package on github. You can varify that it works by doing: 

```
devtools::install_github('koaning/helloworld')
helloworld::hello('foobar')
```
